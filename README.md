# Recursive-Descent-Calculator
Written in Python 3, this program is a calculator which uses recursive descent parsing to calculate the users input. The user will be informed of any potential syntax errors. Standard rules of presedence (for example 4*5+2 = (4*5)+2 rather than 4*(5+2)) will be followed.
